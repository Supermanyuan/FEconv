Installation
===========================================

A) INSTALLATION FROM BINARIES

Just download the file with binaries for one of the available operating systems. No installation is needed.

B) INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE 

You must have installed 'make' in your system and either the GNU Fortran compiler, gfortran, or the Intel Fortran compiler, ifort.

1. Decompress feconv_src_<date>.tar.gz, where <date> is the date of the release.

2. Open a terminal in Linux or Mac OS X, or a Command Window in Windows, go to the installation folder and type:

     make -f Makefile.<compiler>.<os>

   where <compiler> can be "gfortran" or "ifort" and <os> can be "linux" or "windows" (for Mac OS X, "linux" is the valid option).

You can get additional information about this program in the file doc/index.xhtml
